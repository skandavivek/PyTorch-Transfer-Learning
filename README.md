Deep Transfer Learning Tutorial in PyTorch on Animals-10 Dataset

Deep learning on images is extremely popular and every few months there is a new algorithm that pushes the limits on prediction accuracy. 

In this tutorial, I am going to walk through the application of one such state of the art algorithm, Resnet-18 to predict animals from 10 classes using the popular deep learning framework PyTorch which was developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. I'll show how transfer learning can achieve very high accuracies (97% here, on test data).
