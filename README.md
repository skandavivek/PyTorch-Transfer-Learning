Deep learning on images is extremely popular and every few months there is a new algorithm that pushes the limits on prediction accuracy. 

In this tutorial, I am going to walk through the application of one such state of the art algorithm, Resnet-18 to predict **animals from 10 classes** using PyTorch. I'll show how transfer learning can achieve very high accuracies (**97% on test data**).

To run this notebook you need to download the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/alessiocorrado99/animals10
